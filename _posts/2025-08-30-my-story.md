# My Story

Before cybersecurity, I worked on retail floors, managing customers, schedules, and sales. It was rewarding, but I wanted a career with growth, challenge, and long-term potential.

### How it Started
I became curious about cybersecurity after hearing about how critical systems are protected — and how often they’re not. I decided to dive in as a complete beginner, documenting everything I learn along the way.

### Early Challenges
Learning new terminology, understanding networks, and getting hands-on experience was daunting. But step by step, lab by lab, things started clicking.

### Why I Document My Journey
I want other beginners to see that starting from zero is okay. Sharing my notes, labs, and reflections helps me stay accountable and hopefully helps others learn faster.

### Looking Forward
This is just the beginning. In future posts, I’ll share lab exercises, Linux notes, and practical tips for anyone starting in cybersecurity.
